    <h1>Help reform copyright!</h1>

    <p><strong>The European Commission wants to hear your opinion</strong> on copyright reform. The aim of this site is to make it easier for you to respond to the <a href="http://ameliaandersdotter.eu/copyright-consultation-model-responses">official EU consultation</a> by filtering out the questions that do not relate to you directly. Together we can make our opinions and experiences heard!</p>
    <p><small>One more thing: You can answer the question in any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union">24 official European languages</a> you are comfortable with!</small></p>
